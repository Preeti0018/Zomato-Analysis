# Extract geographical-coordinates from data 
Extract latitudes & longitudes from data so that we are able to use maps with help of folium to create HeatMaps
## First create Base map 

![basemap](https://github.com/Preeti0018/Zomato-Analysis/assets/159876174/0bdb974c-9f52-4bb1-866a-70f971d0425e)
## Then create heatmap

![heatmap](https://github.com/Preeti0018/Zomato-Analysis/assets/159876174/e9b19d60-8096-4313-b229-439dece25054)
